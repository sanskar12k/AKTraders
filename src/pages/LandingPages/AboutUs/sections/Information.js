                      <>
                        In 2008, we started with a small store specializing in snacks and cakes. The
                        appreciative response from our community encouraged us to expand into bakery
                        products. In 2014, we broadened our offerings on a larger scale to include
                        daily essentials and grocery items, further meeting the needs of our
                        customer base.
                        <br />
                        In 2016, we took a significant step by setting up our own bakery. This
                        enabled us to produce a variety of baked goods including cakes, pastries,
                        patties, breads, and cookies. Our commitment to quality and innovation led
                        to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
                        <br />
                        By 2019, we had established our second store, which was an extension of the
                        first, primarily focusing on beauty and cosmetic products. Our customer base
                        continued to grow, reaching over 250 daily visitors.
                        <br />
                        During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted by switching to a delivery mode and
                        started home delivery services to ensure our customer s safety and
                        convenience. With the easing of restrictions, we returned to in-store
                        shopping and have since increased our daily customer count to over 300.
